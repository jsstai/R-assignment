# Comments for R-assignment by Grant Nickles

**Inspection of the code**

It looks like he wrote a script instead of a markdown file in order to create the files for the assignment. His code is very well done, and admittingly due to my lack of R knowledge it is hard for me to judge every line. However, I really like how the whole document is extremely well commented, and he included the sections that allows the reviewer to see where the different subsections within the code are.

I attempted running his RScript with the correct fields but I couldn't quite figure out how to get it to work. This is due to my own fault and not his. I've never tried running an RScript, I've only ever seen markdown files before. 

**Production of the files**

He produced all of the needed files, with both the increasing and decreasing order for maize and teosinte. Those files were created by his R Script Convert.R that I couldn't run, however by inspecting his code I was able to logically see that he did all of these steps properly.

**Other requirements on the assignment rubric**

It appears he is missing quite a bit of the requested content that was in the assignment rubric. It was requested that he created an R Markdown file and a simultaneous HRML or PDF output file but neither of them were present in the repository. As such there was never a Data Inspection step, and he appeared to completely not do Part II. I couldn't find any graphs that were saved in the repository, only text documents with the files from the data processing.

Overall make sure you follow the assignment rubric next time! You clearly know your stuff and how to code in R but your repository was missing 50% of what you were supposed to do.
